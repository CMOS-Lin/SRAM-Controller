This loop has been identified in the constraints as being known and understood by use of the ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS property on a net in the loop. The cells in the loop are: FIFO_top_dut/b2v_inst0/error_reg_i_7.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net FIFO_top_dut/b2v_inst0/error_flag0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin FIFO_top_dut/b2v_inst0/error_reg_i_2/O, cell FIFO_top_dut/b2v_inst0/error_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
